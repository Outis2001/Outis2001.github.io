As a result, rice was exported to United Kingdom and other British colonies during the British colonial period (1796-1948). Therefore, paddy cultivation has become one of the major livelihoods among Sri Lankan community. As a result of high productivity and rich diversity of traditional rice, Sri Lanka was once renowned as "the Granary of the East".</p><br>
